# Idea
- Plan to create a program for all types of data structures studied yet
- Create that as an algorithm accessible to all
- Maybe ship it to other too

# Other additions (Linked List Application)
- Polynomial representation
- Multi precision arithematic
- Sparse matrix
- Radix sort
- Bucket sort
- Priority queue

## Requirements
- Data types that may be used in data structures
- May/Will use templates in C++
- Idea will be implemented in Classes
- Methods here will use OOP concepts only because over-writing is available in there

#### NOTE:
``` gcc
g++ Datastructures.cpp <other cpp files> -o final.exe -I <include directory> -L <library location> -l <library name> 
```
